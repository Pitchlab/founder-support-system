# Personal Operating Model Command

Create a comprehensive Personal Operating Model (POM) that defines how you create value, your strengths/weaknesses, failure patterns, decision system, and execution playbook.

## Purpose

This command invokes the `personal-operating-model` skill to interactively create your operating manual covering:
- **Core Loop**: How you transform inputs into outputs
- **Strengths**: Energy-positive capabilities with evidence
- **Unique Edge**: Your asymmetric advantages
- **Weaknesses**: Structural limitations to route around
- **Pitfalls**: Repeating failure patterns with interrupt rules
- **Decision System**: How you should decide (defaults, rules, metrics)
- **Operating Constraints**: Your guardrails and non-negotiables
- **Energy & Rhythm**: Peak windows and burnout indicators
- **Environment Design**: Friction management and amplifiers
- **Execution Playbook**: Your default shipping process
- **Experiments**: System improvements to test

**When to use**: Creating your first POM, major career transitions, annual POM updates, or when patterns have shifted significantly.

## Usage

```bash
/planning-strategy:personal-operating-model
```

**No parameters needed** - the skill guides you through an interactive interview.

## How It Works

This command invokes the `personal-operating-model` skill, which:

1. **Fetches context** from Notion:
   - Year Plan (current focus, OKRs, strategic themes)
   - Golden Rules (working principles)
   - Founder Wisdom (patterns to emulate)
   - Previous POM (if exists)
   - Optional: Recent Quarterly Logs (pattern finding)

2. **Guides you through 11 sections**:
   1. Core Loop (Input → Transformation → Output)
   2. Strengths (energy-positive capabilities)
   3. Unique Strong Points (asymmetric edge)
   4. Weaknesses (structural limitations)
   5. Pitfalls (repeating failure patterns)
   6. Decision System (how you decide)
   7. Operating Constraints (guardrails)
   8. Energy & Rhythm (cognitive weather map)
   9. Environment Design (friction management)
   10. Execution Playbook (how you ship)
   11. Experiments (system improvements)

3. **Asks 3-5 deep questions per section** (not fill-in-the-blank)

4. **Synthesizes answers** into actionable insights

5. **Reviews for consistency** and asks follow-ups

6. **Saves to Notion** POM page

## Time Commitment

**Total**: 60-90 minutes of focused time

**Per section**: 5-8 minutes
- 3-5 interview questions
- Synthesis and confirmation
- Move to next section

**Don't rush this**. Depth > speed.

## What You'll Get

**Comprehensive POM Document** covering:

### 1. Core Loop — How You Create Value
- Inputs you transform best (and should avoid)
- Transformation mechanism (your signature move)
- Outputs that compound
- One-line core loop: "I transform X into Y by Z, producing W"

### 2. Strengths — Energy-Positive Capabilities
For each strength (3-5 total):
- What you do better than most
- Why it works (mechanism)
- Evidence (2-3 examples with outcomes)
- Contexts where it shines vs weakens
- How to exploit it more

### 3. Unique Strong Points — Asymmetric Edge
- Your rare combination (A + B + C)
- Unfair advantage this creates
- Best contexts and timing
- Problems that fit you
- When you win vs lose

### 4. Weaknesses — Structural Limitations
For each weakness (3-6 total):
- What consistently underperforms
- Trigger conditions
- Cost when ignored
- Best mitigation strategy
- Environmental fix
- "Good enough" standard

Categorized as:
- Skill gaps (can train)

- Commitments (long-term contracts/hires)
- Daily Execution (what to do today)

**Evaluation Function**:
- Leading indicators
- Lagging indicators
- Non-negotiable indicators

### 7. Operating Constraints — Guardrails
- Non-negotiables (what you won't do)
- Capacity constraints (max parallel projects/meetings)
- Default "No" criteria

### 8. Energy & Rhythm — Cognitive Weather Map
- Peak windows (deep work, execution, social)
- Low-energy protocol (safe vs danger tasks)
- Burnout indicators (3 warning signs)
- Recovery protocol (minimum viable)

### 9. Environment Design — Make Right Behavior Easier
- Add friction to (stop bad habits)
- Remove friction from (ship more)
- Tools that amplify you
- People archetypes you work best with
- Structures that keep you honest

### 10. Execution Playbook — How You Ship
- Default project phases (5 steps)
- Definition of "Done"
- Quality bar (minimum)

## Example Session Flow

```bash
/planning-strategy:personal-operating-model

Claude:
I'll guide you through creating your Personal Operating Model.

I've reviewed your:
- Year Plan (2026 focus on AI agents, €100K revenue)
- Golden Rules (no meetings before 10am, sales-first)
- Founder Wisdom (Pieter Levels, bootstrapping patterns)

This will take 60-90 minutes. We'll cover 11 sections.

---

**Section 1: Core Loop — How You Create Value**

Think about the last 3 projects where you felt most in flow.
What kinds of raw materials were you working with?

Options:
- Problems that need framing
- Complex systems that need simplification
- Ideas that need connection
- People who need alignment
- Other: [text input]

User: "Complex AI systems that need simplification + strategic framing"

Claude:
When you take those complex AI systems, what do you actually DO to them?
Not the deliverable, but the steps. Do you simplify? Frame? Systematize?

User: "I extract the core mechanism, map it to business value, then create
a narrative that makes it actionable for non-technical leaders"

Claude:
Perfect. Which of your outputs have kept paying you back over time?
What have you created that changed decisions or created durable assets?

User: "Strategic frameworks, positioning narratives, and thought leadership
content that gets referenced months later"

[Continues through all questions...]

Claude:
**Core Loop Synthesis:**

Input → Transformation → Output:
"I transform complex AI systems into strategic narratives by extracting
core mechanisms and mapping to business value, producing frameworks and
thought leadership that compound over time."

Inputs you're best with:
- Complex technical systems needing business translation
- Strategic ambiguity in emerging tech

Inputs you should avoid:
- Highly structured execution work
- Short-form tactical content

Does this capture it? Any adjustments?

User: "Yes, that's accurate."

Claude:
✅ Section 1 complete. Moving to Section 2: Strengths.

[Continues through all 11 sections...]

Claude:
**Final Review**

I've compiled your complete Personal Operating Model.

Observations:
- Your Core Loop aligns with Year Plan focus on thought leadership
- Strength #1 (structural thinking) appears in multiple contexts
- Pitfall #2 (over-architecting) contradicts "ship fast" in Golden Rules
  → Recommend adding interrupt rule: "If outline >3 pages, ship outline first"

Any final adjustments?

User: "Add that interrupt rule to the pitfall."

Claude:
✅ Updated.

Ready to save this Personal Operating Model to Notion?

User: "Yes"

Claude:
✅ Personal Operating Model saved!

```

## Tips for Best Results

### 1. Block Focused Time
- **90 minutes uninterrupted**
- Turn off notifications
- This is strategic work, not admin

### 2. Be Brutally Honest
- This is NOT a resume or LinkedIn profile
- Acknowledge real weaknesses (they're constraints, not flaws)
- Name actual pitfalls (failures you've repeated 3+ times)
- No aspirational BS ("I want to be more organized" ❌)

### 3. Use Concrete Examples
- ✅ "I consistently over-architect. Last 3 projects: spent 2 weeks on frameworks before shipping anything. Cost: missed launch windows."
- ❌ "I sometimes overthink things."

### 4. Push for Evidence
- For strengths: "I did X, which resulted in Y outcome with Z metric"
- For weaknesses: "This failed when... (specific instance)"
- For pitfalls: "3 examples: project A (2023), project B (2024), project C (2025)"

### 5. Design, Don't Wish
- Weaknesses are constraints to route around, not problems to fix
- Pitfalls need interrupt rules ("If X, then stop and do Y"), not motivation
- Environment design beats willpower

### 6. Reference Your Context
- The skill pulls from Year Plan, Golden Rules, Founder Wisdom
- Build on that context
- Point out where POM conflicts with Year Plan (resolve it)

### 7. Make It Actionable
After reading your POM, you should know:
- What work to seek vs avoid
- What decisions to make fast vs slow
- What warning signs to watch for
- What experiments to run next

## When to Use This

**Create Initial POM**:
- ✅ First time setting up Personal Operating Model
- ✅ Major career transition (role change, company change)
- ✅ After 2-3 years without formal self-assessment

**Update POM**:
- ✅ Annually (alongside Year Plan update)
- ✅ After major failures (add to pitfalls)
- ✅ After major successes (confirm strengths)
- ✅ When patterns have shifted (quarterly review reveals changes)

**Reference POM**:
- Daily: Executive Coach uses it for decision guidance
- Weekly: Check against Golden Rules and operating constraints
- Monthly: Review experiments and adjust
- Quarterly: Update based on observed patterns

## Integration with Planning-Strategy Workflow

**POM Feeds Into**:
- **Executive Coach**: Uses POM to understand your strengths/weaknesses for daily coaching
- **Working with Me**: Pulls pitfalls section for "how to work around me"
- **Year Plan**: Aligns OKRs with strengths, designs around weaknesses
- **Quarterly Review**: References POM to identify pattern changes

**POM Is Updated By**:
- **Quarterly Review**: New patterns observed → update pitfalls/strengths
- **Year Plan**: New strategic constraints → update operating constraints
- **Daily Coaching**: Pitfalls triggered → refine interrupt rules

**Typical Flow**:
1. **Create POM**: `/planning-strategy:personal-operating-model` (90 min, once)
2. **Use POM**: Daily coaching references it
3. **Update POM**: Quarterly review updates it (20 min, quarterly)
4. **Evolve POM**: Annual deep update (60 min, yearly)

**Related Commands**:
- `/planning-strategy:year-plan` - Aligns strategy with POM strengths
- `/planning-strategy:quarterly-review` - Updates POM with new patterns
- `/planning-strategy:working-with-me` - Uses POM pitfalls for collaboration
- `/planning-strategy:coach` - References POM for daily decisions

## Success Criteria

A successful POM should:
1. ✅ Define clear Core Loop (Input → Transformation → Output)
2. ✅ Identify 3-5 strengths with concrete evidence
3. ✅ Name 3-6 weaknesses with mitigation strategies
4. ✅ List 3-5 pitfalls with interrupt rules
5. ✅ Specify decision defaults (speed, confidence, rules)
6. ✅ Set operating constraints (non-negotiables, capacity limits)
7. ✅ Map energy rhythms (peak windows, burnout signals)
8. ✅ Define execution playbook (phases, done criteria, anti-stall)
9. ✅ Include 1-3 experiments to test
10. ✅ Be actionable (you can make decisions based on it)
11. ✅ Be honest (not a marketing document)

## Common Pitfalls When Creating POM

**Avoid These**:

1. **Resume Mode**: Writing aspirational strengths instead of honest assessment
   - ❌ "I'm a visionary leader who inspires teams"
   - ✅ "I'm good at extracting core mechanisms from complex systems (evidence: X, Y, Z)"

2. **Vague Weaknesses**: Generic statements without mitigation
   - ❌ "I'm not great at details"
   - ✅ "I skip operational details. Mitigation: use checklist for client onboarding. Partner with detail-oriented PM for delivery."

3. **Motivational Pitfalls**: Treating failure patterns as motivation problems
   - ❌ "I need to be more disciplined about shipping"
   - ✅ "Pitfall: Over-architecting. Interrupt rule: If outline >3 pages, ship outline first. Recovery: Cut to core, ship v1."

4. **Generic Experiments**: Testing abstractions instead of specifics
   - ❌ "Be more focused"
   - ✅ "Experiment: Max 2 parallel projects for 30 days. Success: ship both. Failure: start project #3."

5. **Ignoring Context**: Creating POM in isolation from Year Plan/Golden Rules
   - Connect strengths to Year Plan OKRs
   - Align constraints with Golden Rules
   - Reconcile conflicts explicitly

## Notes

- **Time**: 60-90 minutes total (don't rush)
- **Honesty Required**: This is strategic self-assessment, not self-promotion
- **Living Document**: Update quarterly, reference daily
- **Design Tool**: Use to make decisions, route work, set constraints
- **Integration**: Feeds all planning-strategy coaching and review tools

**Philosophy**: "You're not optimizing yourself. You're designing a system that works."

## Error Handling

If you encounter issues:
- **Overwhelmed**: Split into 2 sessions (Sections 1-6, then 7-11)
- **Vague answers**: Skill will push for specificity with follow-ups
- **Missing context**: Skill will ask for Notion pages if not accessible
- **Contradictions**: Skill will flag and help resolve

## Final Note

Your Personal Operating Model is not a resume. It's not LinkedIn.

It's an operating manual for how you work best - strengths to exploit, weaknesses to route around, pitfalls to interrupt, and experiments to run.

Use it to make better decisions about what work to take, how to structure your time, and what constraints to set.

Update it when patterns change. Reference it daily.

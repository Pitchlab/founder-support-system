# Vision Command

Create a bold, philosophically grounded vision and manifesto that articulates what you stand for.

**Push for substance. Reject bland business speak. Build a vision worth defending.**

## Purpose

This command invokes an interactive vision creation process that:
- Forces clarity on what you actually believe
- Pushes back on generic business speak
- Helps craft a manifesto from the future
- Saves to Notion Vision page

**NOT generic corporate mission statements.**
**NOT ChatGPT business speak.**
**Clarity. Conviction. Edge.**

## Usage

```bash
# Create or update vision
/planning-strategy:vision
```

## How It Works

This command invokes the `vision` skill, which guides you through:

1. **Provocative Questions** (5 foundational questions):
   - Where do humans still matter most when agents become competent?
   - What kind of environment do you need to become dangerously good?
   - What must never be outsourced to machines, even if it could be?
   - What signal do you want people to associate with your name?
   - If you look back in 15 years, what would make this phase feel inevitable?

2. **Challenge the Answers**:
   - Push back on generic/vague responses
   - Force specificity and edge
   - Reject business jargon

3. **Extract Core Beliefs & Themes**:
   - Distill into 3-5 core beliefs
   - Identify how beliefs manifest daily (mission themes)
   - Define lines in the sand (what you refuse)

4. **Draft the Manifesto**:
   - Write from the future ("From here, I can see...")
   - Use "I" not "we" (personal vision)
   - Channel Kevin Kelly / Steve Jobs clarity
   - 600-1000 words of substance

5. **Style Check** (5 tests):
   - Competitor test: Could they say this too?
   - Conviction test: Would you defend this?
   - ChatGPT test: Does it sound AI-generated?
   - Bold formatting test: Do words stand alone?
   - One-line test: Can you summarize it?

6. **Refine & Polish**:
   - Cut ruthlessly
   - Strengthen claims
   - Check rhythm
   - Make every word count

7. **Save to Notion**:
   - Updates Vision page
   - Archives previous version
   - Includes core beliefs, themes, one-line summary

## What You'll Get

A complete Vision page with:

**Manifesto** (600-1000 words):
- Written from the future
- Philosophical but grounded
- Clear stance and conviction
- Passes all 5 style tests

**Core Beliefs** (3-5):
- One-sentence belief
- Practical implication
- Line in the sand (what you refuse)

**Mission Themes**:
- How beliefs show up in daily work
- Evidence of living the theme
- Concrete practices

**One-Line Summary**:
- Entire vision in one sentence

## Time Required

**60-90 minutes** of focused thinking

This is NOT a quick exercise. Block time. Be prepared to:
- Defend your answers
- Get challenged on vague claims
- Iterate multiple times
- Think deeply about what you stand for

## Success Criteria

A successful vision should:
1. ✅ Pass all 5 style tests
2. ✅ Be specific enough to guide decisions
3. ✅ Have 3-5 defendable core beliefs
4. ✅ Feel inevitable (not aspirational)
5. ✅ Make you slightly uncomfortable
6. ✅ Be clear enough that you'd reject opportunities based on it
7. ✅ Sound like YOU, not ChatGPT

## Style Standards

**Good Vision** (Kevin Kelly / Steve Jobs style):
- Clear, direct, specific
- Defensible in a room of skeptics
- Has conviction and edge
- Words do the work (minimal bold formatting)
- Written from the future
- Personal ("I" not "we")

**Bad Vision** (Generic Business Speak):
- "We help people..."
- "Our mission is to..."
- "We believe in excellence..."
- Vague platitudes
- Could apply to any company
- Sounds like ChatGPT wrote it

## Example Opening

```
From here, I can see how it happened.

The machines learned to act. They learned to plan, to delegate,
to correct themselves mid-stride. And for a strange, vertiginous
decade, humanity stood at a threshold most people couldn't name:
the moment when doing became cheap and meaning became the only
scarce resource left.

Most of the industry didn't see it that way. They saw labor costs.
They saw scale. They saw the logical extension of automation into
every crevice of human effort—and they called it progress.

I took a different bet...
```

**Why this works**:
- Sets scene from the future
- Identifies inflection point
- Shows the fork (most people vs you)
- Creates tension
- Promises a stance

## When to Use

**Create New Vision**:
- Starting a new venture
- Major strategic pivot
- Need clarity on direction
- Feeling lost or drifting

**Update Existing Vision**:
- Fundamental beliefs have shifted
- Current vision feels stale/generic
- Business direction has evolved
- Yearly review of core principles

**Challenge Current Vision**:
- Want to test if vision still holds
- Need to articulate beliefs more clearly
- Vision has become too safe/bland

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Block focused time** - 60-90 minutes uninterrupted
2. **Be honest** - Vague visions are useless
3. **Expect pushback** - Generic answers will be challenged
4. **Defend your claims** - If you can't, they're not beliefs
5. **Channel great writers** - Kevin Kelly, Steve Jobs, clear thinkers
6. **Write from future** - Not "will" but "from here, I can see..."
7. **Use "I" not "we"** - This is YOUR vision
8. **Be uncomfortable** - If it's too safe, it's not a vision

## What to Prepare

Before starting, have ready:
- Quiet space for deep thinking
- Current vision (if exists)
- Willingness to be challenged
- Examples of visions you admire
- Core beliefs you're willing to defend

## Related Commands

- `/planning-strategy:year-plan` - Translate vision into annual OKRs
- `/planning-strategy:quarterly-review` - Check alignment with vision
- `/planning-strategy:coach` - Daily tactical guidance aligned with vision

## Notes

- Vision saved to: https://www.notion.so/Your-Vision-Page
- Previous versions archived in same page
- Vision informs Year Plan, Golden Rules, and all strategic decisions
- Best visions are living documents - revisit yearly or when beliefs shift

**Remember**: The goal is not a pretty document. The goal is clarity on what you stand for—so you can defend it, act on it, and build toward it.

If the process doesn't make you uncomfortable, you're not pushing hard enough.

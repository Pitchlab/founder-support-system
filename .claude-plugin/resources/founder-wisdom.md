**Background**: Author of The Millionaire Fastlane. Advocates for achieving financial freedom through entrepreneurship and building scalable systems.
### Golden Rules: The CENTS Framework
1. **Control** - If a company can destroy your business in 5 minutes, you don't have control. Build on platforms you own.
2. **Entry** - Your business must take time and skill to set up. Barriers to entry protect your advantage.
3. **Need** - Your business must fulfill a need or solve a problem people are willing to pay for. No need = no business.
4. **Time** - Your business must make you money when you sleep or take holidays. Decouple time from income.

## Paul Jarvis - The Company of One Advocate
**Background**: Author of Company of One. Advocates for staying small, questioning growth, and building sustainable solo businesses.
### Golden Rules
1. **Question Growth** - A company of one "resists and questions some forms of traditional growth, not on principle, but because growth isn't always the most beneficial or financially viable move."
2. **Focus on Better, Not Bigger** - Be committed to being better instead of bigger. Quality over quantity always.
3. **Create Systems and Automation** - Resist the need for growth by creating systems to get more done in less time.
4. **Start Lean** - When starting out, focus on revenue first. Add expenses and bigger ideas later—once cash is flowing.
5. **Value Autonomy Over Scale** - Bring autonomy, self-reliance, and creativity to your work without becoming a workaholic.
6. **Stay Small for Freedom** - By staying small, you maintain freedom to pursue meaningful pleasures and avoid headaches from employees, meetings, and expansion pressure.
7. **Don't Hire Until Absolutely Necessary** - Solo operations or very small teams often outperform bloated organizations.
8. **Build a Business That Fits Your Life** - Don't build a life that fits your business. Design the business around the life you want.
9. **Profit Per Customer Over Total Customers** - Focus on increasing value per customer rather than constantly acquiring new customers.
10. **Resist the "More" Trap** - More revenue, more customers, more employees doesn't automatically mean more happiness or freedom.

## Jonathan Stark - The Value Pricing Specialist
**Background**: Former software developer turned pricing consultant. Author of "Hourly Billing Is Nuts," host of Ditching Hourly podcast. On a mission to rid the world of hourly billing. Routinely commands an effective hourly rate of $2000+ per hour.
### Golden Rules
1. **Hourly Billing Punishes Expertise** - "It punishes expertise if you're billing for your time. The better you are, the worse you get paid." Hourly billing creates perverse incentives.
2. **Financial Incentives Must Align** - Hourly billing is horrible for everyone involved because the financial incentives of consultant and client are misaligned. You want to work more hours; they want you to work fewer.
3. **Price on Value, Not Time** - Value-based pricing focuses on outcomes or value delivered to the client rather than time spent. Price based on the transformation you create.
4. **Three Alternatives to Hourly** - Info products (courses, books), productized services (fixed scope at published price), and value pricing (custom projects priced on value).
5. **Have the "Why Conversation"** - Before pricing, understand WHY the client wants this done. What's the business outcome? What's it worth to them? This determines your value-based price.
6. **Use the XY Positioning Statement** - "I help X with Y" where X is WHO you help (target market) and Y is WHAT you help them with (their expensive problem). Crystal clear positioning.
7. **Laser-Focused Positioning Statement (LFPS)** - "I am a DISCIPLINE who helps TARGET MARKET with EXPENSIVE PROBLEM. Unlike my competitors, UNIQUE DIFFERENCE." Two sentences that make you memorable.
8. **Offer Three-Tier Pricing** - Always present three options (good, better, best) to give clients choice and anchor them to higher value options.
9. **Focus on Transformation and Outcomes** - Clients don't buy hours of your time. They buy business outcomes, transformations, and results.
10. **Get Off the Hourly Hamster Wheel** - Trading time for money caps your income and devalues your expertise. Build pricing models that reward efficiency and results.
11. **Double Your Income in Year One** - Stark doubled his income in his first year ditching hourly. The potential upside is massive when you align pricing with value.
12. **Position vs. Specialize** - Positioning is strategic marketing to make your business memorable to ideal buyers. Specialization is narrowing focus to a particular subject or skill. Do both.
13. **Productize for Predictability** - Package up a service and sell it like a product with fixed scope at a published price on your website. Removes sales friction and creates predictability.
14. **Explore Subscription Models** - For predictable revenue, consider subscription-based models where clients pay monthly for ongoing value.
15. **The Moral Dilemma of Hourly** - Hourly billing creates a moral dilemma: do you work fast (and get paid less) or slow (and feel like you're ripping off the client)? Value pricing eliminates this.
16. **Sell the Outcome, Not the Process** - Clients don't care about your process. They care about results. Price and sell based on the outcome they'll achieve.
17. **Learn Your Lines** - Have practiced, confident responses to common objections and questions about your pricing. Confidence in delivery matters as much as the price itself.
18. **The $1K Phone Call Challenge** - You should be able to deliver $1,000+ of value in a single phone call. If you can't, you're not positioned as an expert.
19. **Target Expensive Problems** - Focus on helping clients with problems that cost them real money. The more expensive the problem, the more valuable your solution.
20. **Pigeonhole Yourself Deliberately** - Narrow positioning feels scary but makes you the obvious choice for a specific type of client with a specific problem. Riches are in the niches.

## Mike Michalowicz - The Profit First System
**Background**: Author of Profit First, creator of a behavioral approach to accounting that helps small businesses achieve instant profitability. System used by over 1 million companies globally.
### Golden Rules
1. **Profit First, Not Last** - Flip the formula from Sales - Expenses = Profit to Sales - Profit = Expenses. Pay yourself profit first.
2. **Use Four Core Accounts** - Distribute new income into: Operating Expenses, Owner Compensation, Taxes, and Profit. Visual cash management through separate accounts.
3. **Pay Yourself First** - Always allocate profit before paying expenses. This forces you to run a leaner, more profitable operation.
4. **Small Plates Principle** - Use multiple smaller bank accounts (like smaller plates at dinner) to control spending. You can't overspend what's not in the account.
5. **Behavioral Accounting Over Traditional** - Traditional accounting doesn't match human behavior. Build a system that works with your psychology, not against it.
6. **Build Your Profit Percentage Gradually** - Start with 1% profit allocation and increase over time. Don't try to jump to 15% immediately.
7. **Establish Cash Buffers** - Build reserves in your profit and tax accounts. These are your runway when income fluctuates.
8. **Remove Temptation** - Keep profit and tax accounts at a different bank. Make it harder to "borrow" from these sacred accounts.
9. **Rhythm Over Perfection** - Implement the system with discipline and rhythm. Consistency matters more than perfect execution.
10. **Track Real Bank Balances** - Manage your business by looking at actual bank account balances, not complex accounting reports.
